					<h3>Big Data for Decision Making - Helping a hypothetical insurance company by analysing the data and predicting accident severity based on UK gov public accident dataset</h3>
				</header>
				<p>UK accident dataset for 3 years with around 1 million rows was considered for this project. Thorough data wrangling and exploratory data analysis was conducted to identify insights, trends in the dataset. Ultimately the data was trained on multiple different machine learning classification models with extensive hyperparameter tuning to identify the best model which can best predict the target variable - Accident Severity with sufficient accuracy.</p>
