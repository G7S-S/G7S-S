					<h3>Feature Engineering and Feature Selection - Comprehensive Analysis with Machine Learning Simulation [Research Thesis]</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This study addresses the need for a comprehensive framework in machine learning for feature engineering and selection. It begins by introducing the concept of reducible and irreducible errors and demonstrates through simulation that machine learning models struggle to surpass the reducible error threshold. Feature engineering is then shown to break this ceiling by introducing new features. <br>The second part of the study explores various feature engineering and selection methods, providing insights into their mechanisms, functions, applications, and limitations. Overall, this research aims to streamline the adoption of these methods for machine learning practitioners.</p>

					<h3>ML Hackathon - Predicting epitopes for parasite causing chagas disease [Placed 1st]</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Participated in a collaborative hackathon organized jointly by Aston University and SIT Pune, where we tackled a significant data science challenge in the healthcare sector. Our goal was to develop an efficient data mining pipeline to potentially predict new, previously undiscovered epitopes for the parasite responsible for the life-threatening Chagas disease. The dataset was substantial, comprising 390 features and approximately 80,000 observations. One of the key challenges was managing related data rows to prevent potential data leakage in our models. We crafted a model pipeline that involved extensive feature engineering and a meticulous selection process to identify the best model. Our unique problem-solving approach and deep understanding of machine learning techniques led us to secure the top position in the hackathon, earning recognition for our work</p>

					<h3> GenAI Powered Tool for Software Requirement Artifact Analysis</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In the realm of software development lifecycle, viewed from a program management perspective, one of the important objective is well-defined requirement documentation. Statistics suggest that around 60% of defects that surface during a project can be attributed to avoidable errors in the early stages of requirements definition and analysis. To address this critical issue, I designed a tool with the explicit purpose of assisting program managers and testers in assessing the quality of their documented artifacts. Additionally, it offers valuable recommendations on how to structure these artifacts more effectively, thereby significantly reducing errors at the definition stage. The ultimate goal is to save resources in the long term by preventing these errors from snowballing into defects or potentially catastrophic losses in the future. </p>
