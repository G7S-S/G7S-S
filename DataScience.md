					<h3>Feature Engineering and Feature Selection - Comprehensive Analysis with Machine Learning Simulation [Research Thesis]</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This study addresses the need for a comprehensive framework in machine learning for feature engineering and selection. It begins by introducing the concept of reducible and irreducible errors and demonstrates through simulation that machine learning models struggle to surpass the reducible error threshold. Feature engineering is then shown to break this ceiling by introducing new features. The second part of the study explores various feature engineering and selection methods, providing insights into their mechanisms, functions, applications, and limitations. Overall, this research aims to streamline the adoption of these methods for machine learning practitioners.</p>

					<h3>ML Hackathon - Predicting epitopes for parasite causing chagas disease [Placed 1st]</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Hackathon organized between 2 universities Aston University and SIT Pune, working on a Data science problem in healthcare by developing an efficient data mining pipeline to (potentially) predict new, previously unknown epitopes for the parasite causing potentially fatal illness - Chagas disease. The dataset consisted of 390 features with around 80000 observations, challenge mainly included rows being related to each other which increased the risk of data leakage within the model. Model pipeline was designed with various feature engineering and best model selection phase. We were awarded winners of the hackathon due to the approach taken towards the problem and our understanding of the machine learning models and techniques</p>

					<h3> GenAI Powered Tool for Software Requirement Artifact Analysis</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In Software development lifecycle from program management perspective it is important to have well defined requirement documentation. It is estimated that 60% of defects encountered during a project are caused by avoidable errors in requirements definition and analysis stage. This tool was created to help aid program managers and testers get the summary of the quality of the defined artifacts and also sugestions on better way to structure these to ensure error reduction in definition stage so as to save money in the long run when these errors give rise to defects or potentially major loss in the future. </p>
